Text Classification Algorithm
Follow these steps:
1.	Install Required Libraries:
Make sure you have pandas and scikit-learn installed. You can install these using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn
2.	Prepare the Data:
You need to organize your sentences and their corresponding labels. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume you label them based on topics, such as Nature, Technology, Health, etc.

import pandas as pd

sentences = [
    # Your sentences here as listed above
]

labels = [
    'Nature', 'Nature', 'Technology', 'Education', 'Animal', 'Art', 
    'Economy', 'Sports', 'History', 'Food', 'Travel', 'Health', 
    # Repeat labels corresponding to your sentences
]

data = pd.DataFrame({'Sentence': sentences, 'Label': labels})


3.	Splitting the Data:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = data['Sentence']
y = data['Label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
